# 🚗 Insurance Claim Prediction | Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an insurance claim based on customer and policy-related features. Two popular classification algorithms — **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost** — are used, and model performance is evaluated using **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix**.

##  Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

Both models are trained and evaluated on the same dataset for comparison.

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **Confusion Matrix (Visualized using Seaborn)**

These metrics help in understanding the model's ability to correctly predict insurance claims and avoid false positives.
